# How to initiate
1. Clone rep and all that
2. Import libraries and all that if needed
3. Terminal at parent folder and "npm run dev" - this starts the frontend
4. Terminal at parent folder and "cd server/ && node server.js" - this starts the backend, which serves a single, static, JSON, exactly as in task description
5. Literally any issues, call me at 9871624347 or email at uzmanqaisar12@gmail.com

# Issues I faced
1. oolib npm package requires outdated React and Node versions
2. Node itself was having issues with @types/styled-components
3. The "noRefCheck(){} / noRefCheck() {}" bug was solved with 8.0.0, but our docs are yet to be updated. So, can't use oolib anyway.

# How I solved them
1. Ask help from my future colleagues or rollback versions
2. I submitted the issue with npm, and in talks with Storybook about it, will report on change.

# Conclusion
Just give me a bit guidance, and I can produce much better work. Cheers!
